"""
Making a game of Hangman, project 30 - 31.
Part 1, 30 - write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.
part 2, 31 - write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly.
Part 3, 32 - add logic for handling guesses, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.
             keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
             when the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
             rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman.

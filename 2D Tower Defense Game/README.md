- This is a small Java game I've made, a 2D tower defense game that is unfinished and probably won't be finished. 

- The game includes 2 types of turrets, a normal turret and a freezing turret that slows enemy UFOs down.

- There is a money system that awards player money upon killing enemy, and to use earned money to build more turrets, but the money UI was unfinished. 

- The game should run without bugs, but the UI and editor mode(to edit map for enemy UFO path) might be buggy and may cause errors. 

- [TowerDefense.jar](https://github.com/SimonZhang0122/Coding-Projects/blob/433787147111051635f71c3c75a3d8c322d87a44/2D%20Tower%20Defense%20Game/TowerDefense%20.jar) is the compressed game that can be instantly run upon download

- [TowerDefense](https://github.com/SimonZhang0122/Coding-Projects/tree/master/2D%20Tower%20Defense%20Game/Tower%20Defense) contain the Java files for the game.
